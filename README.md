# MyTestProject

Hello!  The ESPN CLI is a simple program that allows its users to easily make a selection based on the sport of their choice, and then receive a couple of article options that may be of interest.  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'my_test_project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install my_test_project

## Usage

Enter 'bin/run' into the console to start the program.  You will then be prompted to select the sport that you would like to receive article options from, or enter 'exit' to exit the program.  In the following menu, you will be shown two article choices to choose from.  Select either 1 or 2.  After you have made your choice, the text from the article will appear.  Once you have read the article, you will have the choice of either reading another article or exiting the program.


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
